        <h2>Bill Cipher</h2>
        <p>Bill Cipher was a triangular inter-dimensional demon, formerly existent only in the mindscape before succeeding in gaining access to the real world. He had been running amok in Gravity Falls, Oregon since being summoned by Stanford Pines over thirty years ago and was also known for his mysterious demeanor and sadistic humor. Bill is the main antagonist of the series.
            He doesn't play a central role in the series until his first physical appearance in "Dreamscaperers". He has background parts, such as the rug in the mystery shack that has a triangle with one eye, and the triangle window in "Tourist Trapped".</p>
